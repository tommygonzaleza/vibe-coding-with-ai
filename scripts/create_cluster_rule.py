This rule helps ensure that new articles link to appropriate landing pages within their topic clusters.

## Landing Pages to Link To

When writing a new article, consider linking to these relevant landing pages:

"""

    # Add each cluster's landing page information with language
    for cluster in clusters:
        # Skip clusters with empty landing page URLs
        if "title" in cluster and "landing_page_url" in cluster and cluster["landing_page_url"]:
            # Get language from cluster or use "Unknown" if not available
            lang_code = cluster.get("lang", "").lower()
            # Map language code to full name or use the code if not in mapping
            language = language_map.get(lang_code, lang_code) if lang_code else "Unknown"
            rule_content += f"- **{cluster['title']}** [{language}]: [{cluster['landing_page_url']}]({cluster['landing_page_url']})\n"
            print(f"Added {cluster['slug']}")
        else:
            print(f"Skipping cluster: {cluster['slug']} because it has no landing page url")
    
    rule_content += """
## Guidelines

1. Each article should link to its cluster's landing page at least once
2. Use descriptive anchor text that includes relevant keywords
3. Place links naturally within the content where they provide value to readers
4. Avoid excessive linking that could appear spammy

## Implementation

When writing content related to any of these topics, include contextually relevant links to the appropriate landing pages.
