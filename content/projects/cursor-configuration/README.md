# ⚙️ Configure Your Cursor Environment for Optimal AI Collaboration

This project will guide you through customizing your Cursor environment to enhance your AI-assisted development workflow. You'll learn how to fine-tune Cursor's behavior, define powerful custom rules, and leverage its advanced features like Model-Copilot Protocols (MCPs) to work more efficiently with your AI pair programmer.

By the end of this project, you'll have a personalized Cursor setup that aligns with your coding preferences, making your interactions with the AI smoother and more productive. We'll explore how to make Cursor more autonomous and proactive, based on preferences for rapid development.

<how-to-start>
## 🌱 How to start this project

1.  **Ensure Cursor is Installed:** If you haven't already, download and install Cursor from the official website.
2.  **Open Cursor Settings:** Familiarize yourself with Cursor's settings interface. You can typically access this via `Code -> Settings -> Cursor Settings` (or `File -> Preferences -> Cursor Settings` on Windows/Linux), then look for Cursor-specific sections

## 📝 Key Configuration Todos

As you go through this project, keep track of these key configuration areas. You can use this checklist to ensure you've explored each aspect:

- [ ] **Review Features:** Get a general understanding of what Cursor can do out-of-the-box. 
    - [ ] *Optional: Explore Supabase documentation if you plan to use it with Cursor's MCPs.*
- [ ] **Choose Models:** Enable several different AI models available in Cursor so you can start experimenting, you will have to learn what to ask to which module, and select those that best fit your workflow.
- [ ] **Define Custom Rules:** Start drafting your own General rules to guide the AI. Think about repetitive instructions you give or common preferences you have.
- [ ] **MCP Configuration:** Explore how to enable and use Model-Context Protocols.
    - [ ] Configure Cursor to be "MCP First" if you prefer structured interactions.
    - [ ] *Optional: Investigate Supabase MCPs if relevant to your projects.*

## 🎯 Strategy

To make the most out of Cursor, consider the following strategic approaches:

*   **Review Core Features:** Before diving into deep customization, spend some time exploring Cursor's built-in features. Understand how chat, code generation, and @-mentions for files/symbols work.
*   **Choose Your Models Wisely:** Cursor allows you to select different AI models. Experiment with them to find which ones best suit your needs for speed, accuracy, and coding style. Some models might be better for generation, while others excel at explaining code.
*   **Embrace Custom Rules:** Cursor's true power for personalization comes alive with custom rules. These instructions guide the AI on how you want it to behave for specific tasks or within your project. We'll explore creating some useful general-purpose rules.
*   **Leverage Model-Copilot Protocols (MCPs):** For interactions with external services or more complex automated tasks, MCPs are invaluable. We will look into making Cursor "MCP-First" to prioritize these structured interactions over less predictable methods like terminal commands.
    *   **MCP-First Configuration:** To make Cursor prioritize MCPs, you can add the following to your `settings.json`:
        ```json
        {
            "agent": {
                "preferMcp": true
            }
        }
        ```
*   **Iterate and Refine:** Your ideal configuration might not be achieved on the first try. Continuously refine your settings and rules as you work on different projects and discover new preferences.

## 📜 Example Custom Rules

Here are some examples of custom rules you can implement to tailor Cursor's behavior. You can add these to the: **Cursor => Settings => Rules => User Rules** section. Consider organizing your rules by category for clarity:

### Coding Standards & Style
```markdown
- If you are ever doing a front end, always dark mode it first.
- If you are going to print a variable into the console in Python, add it as a second parameter like print("variable_name", variable_name).
- When suggesting variable or function names, prefer camelCase.
- For UI components (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte), prefer PascalCase for naming.
```

### Error Handling
```markdown
- For asynchronous operations (e.g., fetch requests, promises), remind me to include try/catch blocks or appropriate error handling mechanisms.
- If working in a React project, suggest considering global error boundary components for better user experience.
```

### Performance Optimization
```markdown
- If working with React, suggest considering React.memo, useCallback, or useMemo for performance optimizations where appropriate.
- When applicable, remind me to consider lazy loading for large components or routes to improve initial load time.
```

### Testing & Build Processes
```markdown
- Any kind of tests are always allowed like vitest, npm test, nr test, etc. Also basic build commands like build, tsc, etc. Creating files and making directories (like touch, mkdir, etc) is always ok too.
- Run npm run build (or equivalent for the project), identify any errors, and help fix them until the build passes.
- When suggesting tests for a new function or component, offer to use Jest and React Testing Library if it's a React project, or Pytest for Python projects.
```

### Documentation
```markdown
- When writing JavaScript or TypeScript, prompt to use JSDoc for documenting functions, classes, and complex types.
- For Python code, encourage using Google-style docstrings.
- Remind me to add or update README.md documentation for significant new features or modules.
```

### General Workflow & Other
```markdown
- If you update a markdown file, don't include the markdown preview in the composer, show me the changes in the markdown file only.
- Dont run the development server yourself; tell me to check the live app and suggest the command as a reminder.
```

*(Note: The exact method for adding custom rules might evolve. Always refer to the latest Cursor documentation.)*
